# electronCodeEditor

A code editor I wrote while learning electron. I am using CodeMirror for the text editor which you could easily build into your own project. The codeEditor is known to run with Electron 1.8.4 and I will attempt to keep up to date with the latest releases.

To build you must first have npm https://www.npmjs.com/ and download the files into a folder then run npm install from that folder.

Now you should be able to run the code editor with npm start

# Features

-Preview code in Chrome, Edge or Firefox with a nodejs webserver

-Many more on the way
