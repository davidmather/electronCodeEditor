# electronCodeEditor

A code editor I wrote while learning electron.To build you must first have node package manager https://www.npmjs.com/ and download the files into a folder then run npm install from that folder

I am using mmmagic for image editing. This is not built for the latest electron version so you must follow the steps outlined in
https://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules/

Now you should be able to run the code editor with npm start

Features
-Preview code in Chrome, Edge or Firefox with a nodejs webserver
-Many more on the way
